The UVIC horticulture club aims to bring those with an interest in gardening together and introduce newcomers to the science and art of horticulture.  
Horticulture is the cultivation of plants for food, medicine and aesthetic purposes. We hope to work on projects, bring in guest speakers, and discuss similar and differing interests regarding plants and growing them. We welcome anyone with any level of interest in plants to join!
